I'm using http://www.arcgis.com/home/content.html as a way to test adding an authenticated service (I'm not sure if that's the best way or not, see the recordit below)

click the "Add Item" button on the top left and then click "From Url" 

paste in the URL: http://localhost:8080/arches/test/geoms/FeatureServer/2

notice how it asks for username and password

I was using admin/amdin

at that point an error pops up

if you look at the console for the koop server you'll notice only the "authorize" method is called 

if you try and manually get a token by hitting this url http://localhost:8080/arches/tokens?username=admin&password=admin then you'll notice that the "authenticate" method is hit
