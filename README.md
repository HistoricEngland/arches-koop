# Arches Koop Application

### Dev Server

This project by default uses the [Koop CLI](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-cli) to set up the dev server. It can be invoked via

```
$ yarn start
```

The server will be running at `http://localhost:8080` or at the port specified at the configuration.

For more details, check the [Koop CLI documentation](https://github.com/koopjs/koop-cli/blob/master/README.md).
